# - Common configuration for all nodes are in role docker-common
# - Configuration for only the master are in role docker-master
# - Configuration for the worker nodes are in role docker-worker

# - kubernetes-cluster  (all cluster nodes)
# - kubernetes-master   (master node(s))
# - kubernetes-worker   (worker/minion nodes)
