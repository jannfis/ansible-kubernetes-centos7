# Important licensing information

The files contained in the features directory are not covered by the Unlicense
terms. They were collected from various sources, and therefore are covered by
their own licenses.

I put together all license files from the projects source code repositories to
the respective folders.

I'm unsure how the Kubernetes template files are covered by this licenses, but
I included them for completeness.
